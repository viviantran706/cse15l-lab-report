```
The working directory at this point was the home directory (/home).

The output of this command when ran was empty becuase cd is the command that
changes the directory so when there no direction there will be no output. Which
is normal due to the nature of this command.

The out of this is not an error.

```
The directory that I was at before running this was /home but after running this
the new directory is /lecture1/.

The output of this was taking us to the new directory (/lecture1). So this changed
us form the /home directory to /lecture1/ directory. Else nothing was printed.

This did not give us an error becuase it did do its job of changing out directory.

```
The working directory before running this command was /home.

The output we got was ann error because the nature of this command is take us to a
directory and not a file. CD is only suppose to change the current directory to a
new directory, which is not a file.

The outut is an error because cd is not meant to be directed to a file. Therefore
that is why we can not use a file as the argument. The purpose of cd is to change
directories with in the file system.

## Command - ls

```
The current directory is /home.

The reason why the output was lecture is because ls is suppose to be used to list
all of the files and directories that in the cureent directory. So if there is no
arguent that would mean the output would just be the files and directories names.

The outpit was not an error.

```
The current directory is /home.

The reaosn why the output were a list of all the files is because ls shows what files or directories are in the current director (folder) there fore if we looked in at the files we would see that with in the messages folder the outputs would be en-us.txt es-mx.txt and zh-cn.txt.

This is not an error

```
The current directory is /home.

The reason why this is the output is because ls will attempt to list out information about th efiles with in the folder. SO when ls to a file will just print out that argument becuase there are no other files in there.

There are no errors with this command.
```

## Command - cat

```
The current directory is /home.

The reason why the output is this is becuase cat, it prompts you to input text inand when you enter it it will echo back (which is shown in the screenshot).

There are no errors.
```

```
The current directory is /home.

The output prints "Is a directory" because when you try to use cat on a direcctory it is not a vaild thing. Therefore that is why it prints this message.

There are no errors wiht this.

```
The current directroy is /home.

The output prints what is in the file. Because cat is used or displaying the thinsg with in the text files. Therefore opening the file will show that it will print exactly what is in the file.

There are no errors with this
```
