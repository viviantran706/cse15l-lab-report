```
The working directory at this point was the home directory (/home).

The output of this command when ran was empty becuase cd is the command that
changes the directory so when there no direction there will be no output. Which
is normal due to the nature of this command.

The out of this is not an error.

The directory that I was at before running this was /home but after running this
the new directory is /lecture1/.

The output of this was taking us to the new directory (/lecture1). So this changed
us form the /home directory to /lecture1/ directory. Else nothing was printed.

This did not give us an error becuase it did do its job of changing out directory.

The output we got was ann error because the nature of this command is take us to a

directories with in the file system.

```
The current directory is /home.

The reason why the output was lecture is because ls is suppose to be used to list
all of the files and directories that in the cureent directory. So if there is no
arguent that would mean the output would just be the files and directories names.

The outpit was not an error.

The current directory is /home.

The reaosn why the output were a list of all the files is because
